Attendees of the workshop are expected to bring their own computer and be able
access the internet wirelessly at the workshop venue (e.g., using eduroam or the
attendee's own mobile internet access).

Before the workshop begins, the attendees will need to have the most up to date
versions of the __R__ programming environment, the __RStudio__ development
environment and the __FinBIF R package__, and have obtained a
__FinBIF API access token__.

Follow the instructions in each section in order to get setup.

If you have a university computer and do not have admin rights you can install
__R__ and __RStudio__ using the university _Software Center_ and then skip
to step 3 [Install the FinBIF R package](/setup/finbif/)
