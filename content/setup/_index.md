Attendees of the workshop are expected to bring their own computer and be able
access the internet wirelessly at the workshop venue (e.g., using
[eduroam](https://www.eduroam.org/) or the attendees' own mobile internet
access).

Before the workshop begins, the attendees will need to have the most up to date
versions of the [__R__ programming environment](https://www.r-project.org/),
the [__RStudio Desktop__ development environment
](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/), the [__FinBIF R package__
](https://luomus.github.io/finbif/), and have obtained a __FinBIF API access
token__.

Though not essential, attendees may also find it useful to install [Rtools
](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) (for Windows) or the [Xcode
Command-Line Tools
](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/technotes/tn2339/) (for Mac).
These tools are neccessary to install some R packages from source.

Follow the instructions in each section in order to get setup[^1].

### [Begin setup steps __>__](/setup/r/)

[^1]: If you have a university computer and do not have admin rights you can
install  __R__ and __RStudio__ (and Rtools/Xcode Command Line Tools) using 
your university _Software Center_ and then skip to step 3 [Install the FinBIF
R package](/setup/finbif/).
