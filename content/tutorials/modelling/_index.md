The following tutorial is a quick demonstration of building a species
distribution model (SDM) using Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt). This tutorial is not
supposed to represent best practice for SDM contruction but simply highlight the
key steps that you'll need to perform in order to build a distribution model
using FinBIF (or similar) data. In practice a more rigorous consideration of the
input data and methods used is required to produce meaningful results.
