Welcome to the FinBIF R workshop. The Finnish Biodiversity Information Facility,
FinBIF, aggregates Finnish biodiversity data from multiple sources in a single
open access database for researchers, citizen scientists, industry and
government. FinBIF allows users of biodiversity information to find, access,
combine and visualise data on Finnish plants, animals and microorganisms.

The `{finbif}` R package makes the publicly available data in FinBIF easily
accessible to researchers and programmers. Biodiversity information is
available on taxonomy and taxon occurrence. Occurrence data can be filtered by
taxon, time, location and other variables. The data accessed are conveniently
preformatted for subsequent analyses.

In this workshop attendees will learn how to access FinBIF using the `{finbif}` R
package. Topics covered include: installing the package, accessing the
documentation and getting help, working with taxonomic information, accessing
collection information, getting and filtering occurrence records, creating
graphics from FinBIF data and fitting models to FinBIF data.
